CSS creation for samui-samui.de

- SASS files are in assets/sass/theme.scss
- several Bootstrap items are disabled to keep the file small
- minification is done here via SASS outputStyle compressed. 
- possible values for dev: nested*, expanded, compact and compressed
- yep, we use source maps ("enableSourceMap" true)
- floating point precision must be at least 6 for Bootstrap compatibility
- imports via "includePaths" are executed from within node_modules directory
- SRI is applied via Fingerprint
- that's all for now. but it's enough, isn't it?
